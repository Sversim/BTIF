var cont = `<p>There once was a ship that put to sea<br/>
The name of that ship was a Billy of Tea<br/>
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down<br/>
Blow, my bully boys, blow<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
She had not been two weeks from shore<br/>
When down on her, a right whale bore<br/>
The Captain called all hands and swore<br/>
He'd take that whale in tow<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
Before the boat had hit the water<br/>
The whale's tail came up and caught her<br/>
All the hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br/>
When she dived down below<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
No line was cut, no whale was freed<br/>
The Captain's mind was not on greed<br/>
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed<br/>
She took that ship in tow<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
For 40 days or even more<br/>
The line went slack then tight once more<br/>
All boats were lost, there were only four<br/>
But still that whale did go<br/>
<br/>
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on<br/>
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone<br/>
The Wellerman makes his regular call<br/>
To encourage the Captain, crew and all<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
<br/>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguin' is done<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
We'll take our leave and go<br/>
We'll take our leave and go  <br/>
